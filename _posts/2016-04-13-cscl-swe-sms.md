New! My systematic mapping study on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning in Software Engineering Education [has now been published](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288184552_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning_in_Software_Engineering_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study). It cites and summarizes the results of over a hundred publications in the field of CSCL.

#### Wut?
A systematic mapping study (SMS) is a secondary study that aims at classification and thematic analysis of earlier research. According to [Kitchenham and Charters](http://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/525444systematicreviewsguide.pdf) performing a SMS can be especially suitable if few literature reviews are available on the topic and there is a need to get a general overview of the field of interest. It can also be used to identify research gaps in the current state of research.

#### Paper Abstract
Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has been a steady topic of research since the early 1990s, and the trend has continued to this date. The basic benefits of CSCL in the classroom have been established in many fields of education to improve especially student motivation and critical thinking. In this paper we present a systematic mapping study about the state of research of computer-supported collaborative learning in software engineering education. The mapping study examines published articles from 2003 to 2013 to find out how this field of science has progressed. Ongoing research topics in CSCL in software engineering education concern wider learning communities and the effectiveness of different collaborative approaches. We found that while the research establishes the benefits of CSCL in several different environments from local to global ones, these approaches are not always detailed and comparative enough to pinpoint which factors have enabled their success.
