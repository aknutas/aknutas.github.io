*Figure: Three Pillars of Civic Coding Best Practices*

Recently we published a scientific magazine article on civic code and what software engineers should know about it. My co-authors and I are quite excited, since the format allows us to condense the highlights from our line of research into a compact "this is what you need to know" package. The article was published in *IEEE Software*, a magazine for software professionals. It's a quick read, so if you find this topic at the intersection of free/open source software and social change of interest, do follow the link below. We also list below some key highlights from the article.

- Civic coders can accomplish much, but they are also easily sidelined or harmed by activities done by more structured actors.
- When working with civic tech communities, it is important to go beyond the usual requirements engineering process and ensure open and equitable participation.
- Free and open-source software licenses are the key to enabling transparency, agency, and accountability in civic tech projects.

#### Abstract
The creation of code for improving civic participation in societal processes is often referred to as civic tech. Software engineers are increasingly likely to work with civic tech initiatives or as part of volunteer efforts during their careers. It is important to raise awareness about the civic tech phenomenon and how it relates to the field of software engineering. We explore the best practices for civic tech grassroots that software engineers should be aware of when working with - or as - civic coders through a case study.
