For the first article in my blog I'll introduce the [NAILS project](http://nailsproject.net). It is a collection of cloud-based tools for performing statistical and Social Network Analysis (SNA) on citation data. SNA is a new way for researchers to map large datasets and get insights from new angles by analyzing connections between articles. As the amount of publications grows on any given field, automatic tools for this sort of analysis are becoming increasingly important prior to starting research on new fields. *nails* also provides useful data when performing systematic mapping studies in scientific literature.

### Science!

The basic design and bibliometric principles of the system have been published in a research article:

Antti Knutas, Arash Hajikhani, Juho Salminen, Jouni Ikonen, and Jari Porras. 2015. Cloud-Based Bibliometric Analysis Service for Systematic Mapping Studies. *In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies (CompSysTech '15)*. DOI: 10.1145/2812428.2812442

A preprint version of the article is [available for download](http://www.codecamp.fi/lib/exe/fetch.php/wiki/nails-compsystech2015-preprint.pdf) as PDF. The official version is also available in the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2812428.2812442).
