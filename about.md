I'm a D.Sc. (Tech) and a researcher at [Lappeenranta University of Technology](http://www.lut.fi) School of Business and Management, working in the [Software Engineering](http://www.lut.fi/web/en/school-of-business-and-management/research/industrial-engineering-and-management)  competence area. My current research interests include computer-supported collaboration, computer-supported education, gamification, data mining, social network analysis and smart cities. I am also involved in the [NAILS project](http://nailsproject.net) and [The Contrivance Engine](http://www.tce.fi).

You can find more information about my current projects in this website, from my list of [publications](/publications/) or in the following pages.
