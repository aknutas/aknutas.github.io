title: About

I'm a D.Sc. (Tech) and a postdoctoral researcher in the software engineering group at the [Lappeenranta University of Technology](http://www.lut.fi/). My research interests involve computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), non-traditional software engineering processes of digital services, and the design of community-driven socio-technical systems from a software engineering perspective. The design of software that promotes community engagement and collaboration e.g. with gamification is most recent application area of socio-technical system design which I have worked on. My research methods include both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and I aims to provide prescriptive, actionable knowledge that will inform the future design of such systems or their software construction processes. I also work with the [Dublin City University's](http://www.lut.fi) [BIGroup](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Business-Informatics-Group-BIGroup-Markus-Helfert) research team.

You can find more information about my current projects in this website, from my list of [publications](/publications/) or in the following pages.

### Cool Projects

Some cool projects I have been involved in:

* [NAILS project](http://nailsproject.net) - cloud-based bibliometrics. What can be more nifty than that?
* [TinyCircle](https://github.com/aknutas/TinyCircle) - a peer to peer mobile prototype application from 2012 that routed around blockages and censorship. See the [Youtube video](http://youtu.be/N1Uz0OsoEcU) for more information.
* [Automatic Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/aknutas/sna-saga) for online forums.
* [Snooze Ry.](http://www.snooze.fi) I'm a member of the board in a Finnish youth organization that arranges LAN parties.

Have questions, proposals or something that we could collaborate on? Drop me a [message in Twitter](https://twitter.com/aknutas).
