title: About

I'm a D.Sc. (Tech) and an associate professor at [Department of Software Engineering](https://www.lut.fi/en/about-lut/faculties/lut-school-engineering-science/software-engineering) in [LUT University](http://www.lut.fi/). My research interests involve human factors in software engineering, software communities and collaboration, and civic technology from a software engineering perspective. My current research area is how grassroots civic tech groups design, create, and share software. Another recent research area is how the design principles of sociotechnical software systems can promote community engagement and collaboration. My research methods include both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and I aim to provide prescriptive, actionable knowledge that will inform the future design of such systems or their software construction processes. In addition to research at LUT, I have worked with the [PONG labs](https://pong.di.unimi.it/) at the University of Milan and the [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/about/elite-technological-university) branch of [Marsouin](https://www.marsouin.org/article625.html).

You can find more information about my current projects in this website, from my list of [publications](/publications/) or in the following pages.

##### Research Groups & Projects
 
 * [AMIGOS project](https://amigos-project.eu/) - I am currently the LUT primary investigator in the AMIGOS Horizon Europe project for designing sustainable urban mobility. My research interests link to designing with people and technology processes.
 * [COALESCE](https://coalesceproject.eu/) - the European Competence Centre for Science Communication where my colleague Annika Wolff is the PI.
 * [Software Engineering degree program](https://www.lut.fi/fi/opiskelu/tekniikka/tietotekniikan-kandidaattiohjelma) at LUT University - I am currently the head of the BSc. degree program in Software Engineering at LUT University.

### Fun Coding Projects

Some cool projects I have been involved in:

* [Workshop tutorials](https://parcos-project.eu/avi2022/) on open science publication processes for research data and analysis
* [Palaute system](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3964072) was a MSc. thesis project from my lab that resulted in a web-based student feedback text mining tool and a related [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116425).
* [NAILS project](https://anttiknutas.net/nails/) - cloud-based bibliometric social network analysis.
* [Ludus Engine](https://github.com/aknutas/ludusengine) - an algorithm for creating adaptive gamification challenges for CSCL environments.
