My current research interests include computer-supported collaboration, data mining, social network analysis, computer-facilitated education and bibliometrics. I am also involved with the [NAILS project](http://nailsproject.net) and [The Contrivance Engine](http://www.tce.fi).

Some cool projets I have been involved in:
