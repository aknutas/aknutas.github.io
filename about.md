I'm a D.Sc. (Tech) and an assistant professor in software construction working with the software engineering research group at the [LUT University](http://www.lut.fi/). My research interests involve human factors in software engineering, computer-supported collaboration, and civic technology from a software engineering perspective. My current research area is how grassroots civic tech groups design, create, and share software. Another recent research area is how the design principles of sociotechnical software systems can promote community engagement and collaboration. My research methods include both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and I aim to provide prescriptive, actionable knowledge that will inform the future design of such systems or their software construction processes. In addition to research at LUT, I have worked with the [BIGroup](http://big.computing.dcu.ie/) research team at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/) and the [PONG labs](https://pong.di.unimi.it/) in the University of Milan.

You can find more information about my current projects in this website, from my list of [publications](/publications/) or in the following pages.
