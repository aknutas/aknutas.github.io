**AVI 2022 conference tutorial by Antti Knutas, Natasha Tylosky, and Tanvir Hasan**

### Abstract

Open data is increasingly important in European research projects due to personal or organizational commitment to open data, such as Horizon funding requirements. This tutorial begins with a review of how H2020 guidelines have been met in example projects and publications, and continues with a practical demonstration of how both research processes and research data can be processed and published openly with RStudio, RMarkdown, and Zenodo pipeline. We will conclude with a shared discussion of current challenges and exceptions to open publishing.

Thank you for your interest in the workshop! In this workshop, we cover open data requirements from a research project perspective, briefly recap open science data, and present a sample workflow that can assist you in opening up your both analysis process and data.
