Thanks for your interest! I supervise MSc. theses at LUT University for our software engineering (and other specializations such as software business, digital transformations or DSSD). I have listed below some current topics that match my current research directions. If you find one of these topics to be of interest and are seeking a 1st supervisor, do send me an email.

- Developer social networks / open source project networks â€“ how programmers use GitHub
- Why do developers participate in open source or civic tech? (literature review work)
- Literature review of software design processes in open source software
- Software repository data mining and detecting issues ("social smells") from civic tech repositories (or training an machine learning model to detect these issues)
- Modelling civic tech / OSS development or repository networks (social network analysis)
- Series of topics on gameful or playful interaction design


List updated in March 2024.

Doctoral dissertation opportunities are listed publicly at the LUT ["work for us"](https://www.lut.fi/en/about-us/come-work-us/open-positions) page. BSc. thesis topics can be found at the BSc. seminars Moodle page.
