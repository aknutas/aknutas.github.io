We have published our full case study and recommendations for applying flipped classroom in teaching programming at university level. Flipped classroom is a teaching method where students first study theory by themselves as a pre-assigned homework and then learn in the classroom by working on exercises. This is the opposite of the traditional "listen at class and then work alone at home" approach, hence the term "flipped". This approach aims to maximize the usefulness of the time the teacher and the students spend together.

To summarize, in the paper we published the following recommendations:
* Create or curate videos in addition to text-based material
* Video curating suggested, if the instructor intends to hold small lectures
* Use weekly quizzes to evaluate the level of understanding and satisfaction
* Strictly integrate the theory and material to the course
* Encourage students to engage peers in-class and to review each other's work 
* Require students to start the weekly tasks before the exercises as preparatory work

#### Abstract
The flipped classroom teaching method, which emphasizes independent learning of theory and practical, in-depth exercises in the classroom, is gaining foothold in teaching. The method is increasingly being applied at university level. It has been implemented with varying approaches and guidelines, and a single unified process has not been described. In this article we compare existing literature to two case studies where flipped classroom was introduced to teaching. We discuss the lessons learned in these cases and present recommendations based on our experiences. Flipping the classroom has been found to be more efficient than traditional lecture-exercises method and the findings in this study support this. Therefore we recommend teachers to explore the possibility of utilizing the flipped classroom method in their courses.
