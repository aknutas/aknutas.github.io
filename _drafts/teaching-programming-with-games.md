There are many approaches to teaching the basics of programming from traditional lecture-type teaching in universities to interactive courses ([CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com)) to MOOCs ([mooc.fi](http://mooc.fi)). I recently taught a basics of programming course for teenagers, commissioned by the local center of STEM education, [LUMA](http://luma.fi). The course lasted for five days with the goal of introducing complete novices to the basics of programming (variables, control structures, loops) and basics of game development.

One of the basic premises for the course were that students are more highly motivated to learn programming when the skills have immediate and interesting opportunities to apply. That is why the development environment for the course was [Unity](http://unity3d.com), which is a physics-engine centered game development environment. The basic interface of Unity resembles an user-friendly 3D modeling program, where one can deploy basic geometric shapes and imported 3D models. These objects and the environment can then be further controlled with C# or JavaScript programming language.

The curriculum of the course included..

The outcomes of the course were very positive, with all the students with full attendance passing all assignments and improving on the basic game with different features.
