Gamification is a hot topic in research and it has been widely applied to the web. However... (write) Our proposed solution is to use an evidence-based method for deciding which gamification elements to apply and how to apply them. In order to do this built behavior profiles with interaction analysis and profiling surveys. These profiles and the collected profiles of interactions can be used to model how different students react to gamification elements and the available goals in order to create or improve adaptive gamification systems.

We discovered four types of activitiy profiles, compared them with Bartle types (2004) and matched them with formal elements of game design (Fullerton, 2008) that might be most attractive to each cluster. xx continue xx

#### Science!
We used [Social Network Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) and [K-Means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to construct the profiles. There is a Prezi [presentation](http://goo.gl/loaU9Z) from a previous study that visualizes some of the data collection methods.

#### Abstract
Benefits of collaborative learning are established and gamification methods have been used to motivate students towards achieving course goals in educational settings. However, different users prefer different game elements and rewarding approaches and static gamification approaches can be inefficient. We present an evidence-based method and a case study where interaction analysis and k-means clustering are used to create gamification preference profiles. These profiles can be used to create adaptive gamification approaches for online learning or collaborative learning environments, improving on static gamification designs. Furthermore, we discuss possibilities for using our approach in collaborative online learning environments. 

#### Extra Content: Activity Clusters
Below you can find a list of the activity clusters we discovered, with the corresponding Bartle player types and formal game elements that could be applied to each cluster.
