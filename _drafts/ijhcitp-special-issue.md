Last year I was invited to become a guest editor in the [education-related issue](https://www.igi-global.com/pdf.aspx?tid%3D187005%26ptid%3D158533%26ctid%3D15%26t%3DGuest%20Editorial%20Preface) in the [International Journal of Human Capital and Information Technology Professionals](https://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-human-capital-information/1152) by the main editor [Ricardo Colomo-Palacios](https://twitter.com/rcolomo). It was my experience of the other side of the academic publishing process.
